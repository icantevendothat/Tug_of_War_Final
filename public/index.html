      <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <p>Click on your assigned arrow key as fast as you can within a 30-second time frame to pull the rope to your side. The player with the most clicks at the end of the timer wins the game. Here's how to play

      Setup:
      *  Choose your user or character.
      *  Make sure you have a clear understanding of your assigned arrow key. 
      *  You will be competing against an opponent who will be using a different arrow key.
      Gameplay:
      * Once you have selected your user and the game starts, the 30-second timer will begin counting down. May the strongest player win!
